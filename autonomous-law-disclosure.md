<b>Autonomous Lawyering--No Atty/Client Relationship!!!</b>

I am a lawyer admitted to practice in California. 

Unless we have entered into a written engagement letter providing for paid legal services, I am not your lawyer and do not represent you or your interests.

From time to time I engage in "autonomous lawyering," which means that in analyzing or discussing law or situations involving legal issues, I am representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. These communities and the persons in them are not my clients and I have no intention to treat their information as confidential or attorney-client privileged. I am acting on my own behalf, but will seek to provide accurate and honest information while observing my general nonrepresentational professional responsibilities such as demonstrating respect for the legal system. 

In engaging in autonomous lawyering, I am not acting on behalf of my law firm or any other employer of mine, nor on behalf of my clients (i.e., those with whom I have signed engagement letters providing that I will act as their attorney). If my views expressed in autonomous lawyering contexts are inaccurate, there will be no legal recourse against me and an injured party will not be covered by malpractice insurance.

For more about autonomous lawyering, please see [link](https://metalex.substack.com/p/autonomous-lawyering). 

<b>Liquid Tokens</b>

As a personal user of blockchain technologies, I hold BTC, ETH, and various other tokens bought on the open market, received as cash-equivalent compensation in routine business transactions or received in airdrops, staking or similar open distributions. I will typically not disclose open-market-bought positions unless they are material (either to myself relative to my overall holdings or relative to the overall project distribution). I own a relatively substantial amount of Radbros and Schizoposters NFTs. 

<b>MetaLeX</b>

I am founder of and own a majority interest in [MetaLeX](https://www.metalex.tech/), which includes a crypto-oriented law firm and a tech company specializing in cybernetic entities and other code/law/governance solutions. MetaLeX will periodically receive early-stage token and/or equity allocations from its clients, some of which may be material, as well as ecosystem grants for building MetaLeX on certain chains etc. Legal engagements of MetaLeX, and identities of clients of MetaLeX, may be confidential and unable to be dislcosed. 

MetaLeX has done significant work for Matter Labs (mainly oriented around creation of DAO-adjacent entities), the development company of the ZKsync protocol, and holds rights to a modest amount of $ZK tokens and Matter Labs equity shares. MetaLeX may continue to perform work for ZKsync-related entities from time to time. I intend to serve as one of the ZKsync Guardians. 

MetaLeX has also performed significant work realted to the Lido ecosystem, and cyberâ€¢Fund is both a significant investor in the Lido ecosystem and the lead investor for MetaLeX Labs (see [MetaLeX fundraise announcement](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/24/crypto-governance-advisory-metalex-raises-275m/)). 

<b>Delphi Digital</b>

As former General Counsel of [Delphi Labs](https://delphidigital.io/labs) and an LP in and advisor to [Delphi Ventures](https://www.delphiventures.com/), I have direct or indirect economic interests in the equity and/or tokens of various entities, launched projects and pre-launch projects. From Delphi Labs these include a material amount of $MARS and $ASTRO tokens (some held directly, some indirectly through Delphi Labs equity) and, through Delphi Labs equity, potentially valuable interests in [Legion](https://legion.cc/an-honest-musing), [Resolv](https://resolv.finance/) and [Levana](https://www.levana.finance/). From Delphi Ventures these include a potentially valuable interest in $ENA among other venture investments.
